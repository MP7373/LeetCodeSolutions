# LeetCodeSolutions

Just putting these practice problems in source control so I
can track my progress over time outside of the leetcode site
interface.

## problems-by-id directory

These are just random problems I did.

They are saved in the format:
problem\_(problem ID) followed by the name of the problem with kabob, pascal, camel, or whatever casing is most popular in the language used.

You can search the problems by problem ID on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)

## monthly-leetcode-challenges directory

These are my solutions for the problem a day challenges leetcode
did starting in April 2020.
